# Interactive E-Commerce Store with Payment Integration

## Overview
This project simulates an interactive e-commerce store where users can browse products, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed with checkout. The system includes a dynamic cart, a user profile creation process, and payment integration, with a randomly generated confirmation number for each successful transaction. It leverages Python and a mock dataset of products for simulating a real-world e-commerce experience.

## Features
- **Product Catalog:** Displays a variety of products with their names, prices, and categories.
- **Cart Management:** Users can add multiple products to the shopping cart.
- **User Profile Creation:** Users are prompted to enter their name and email to create a shopping profile.
- **Checkout Process:** Users can view their cart, total amount, and proceed to checkout.
- **Payment Integration:** Upon checkout, users are provided with a randomly generated confirmation number to simulate payment success.
- **Data Source:** The project uses a mock dataset, inspired by the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to simulate real-world products.
